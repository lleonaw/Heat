Code from laptop, dg and spectral code working, but 
extended code unfinished( barely started).

Copied inv6_new from 4isen/mgrind/ 
Do 2D NS from it. 
Get diffusion to work first

Currently I have 2nd order convergence with
Ne = 2, N = 2^j
Except for Ne = 2, N = 4, in which case 
the code blows up. 
Very weird.

OVERHAUL:
  - Only interested in timestepping operator
  - Eigenvalues problems are for inv(B) K
  - Combine eig code back into time-stepping code, make sure it's the same thing
  - 2D eig
